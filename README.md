# Micro-Processor
5th semester, Micro Processor course

This repository is about the micro-processor course projects.<br>
we studied about risc architecture by ARM architecture, and cisc architecture by x86 architecture.<br>
we used cortex-m4 bord for our ARM projects and the i-core computer's assembler of linux system for x86 projects.<br>
ARM projects were mostly about reading and using the register map and x86 projects were mostly about the dataflow like the protected mode, interrupt, exception, table switch, and so on.
